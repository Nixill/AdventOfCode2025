<h1>Day 1: Secret Entrance</h1>

<p>There is a door in front of you. Its dial is currently set to @dial.</p>

<p>
  How many times has it moved to zero? Well, that depends on how you're counting, I suppose.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    If you're just counting the number of times it stopped at zero (part 1), that'd be @stopCount.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you're counting the number of times it touched zero at all, even during a move (predicted part 2-A), then it's
    @passCount.
  </li>
  <li>
    Lastly, if you're counting the number of times it reached zero and then turned around (predicted part 2-B), then
    it's @turnCount.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You can enter a single instruction to move the dial here:<br />
  <TextInput @ref="instructionInput" ValueChanged="(value) => PerformInstruction(value)" /><br />
  @lastOutput
</p>

<p>
  You can also select a file to read all of its instructions at once:<br/>

  @foreach (var file in Directory.EnumerateFiles(Directory.GetParent(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())?.FullName + "/AoC2025Data/day1"))
  {
    <Button @onclick="() => ParseFile(file)">@Path.GetFileName(file)</Button>
  }
</p>

<p>
  And lastly, you can reset the dial and counters by clicking <Button @onclick="() => ResetEverything()">here</Button>.
</p>
